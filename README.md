# Simple-Java-Cryptography

The purpose of this code is to display my understaning of Inheritance and Polymorphism. 
The interface class contains 3 constants that are required for the respective ciphers.
In the caeser cipher, letters of the alphabet are shifted by three, wrapping around at the end of the alphabet. 
In a transpose cipher, letters in the original message are re-arranged in some methodical way â€“ for instance, 
reverse the letters in each string. Thus the string the quick brown fox becomes eht kciuq nworb xof.
Finally a reverse cipher does not only reverses the letters in each word, but as does the Transposition cipher, 
but it also reverses the result generated from the Transposition cipher. Hence the original message the quick brown fox becomes 
xof nworb kciuq eht.
